--- Google cloud server setup ---

1. Create a new google cloud project

2. Go to "VM instances" (located in the side bar)

3. Create a new VM instance 
 - Set an external IP
 - Create firewall rules to allow access through necessary ports
 - Set desired machine (probably "small" or a similar option)

4. Setup signaling server
 - Open the server terminal (Click the SSH button in the VM instances overview)
 - Pull the WebApp repository (with both "Dockerfile" and "docker-compose.yml").
 - CD to the WebApp repository location
 - Run "docker-compose up"


--- Unity setup ---

1. Add the render streaming package from the unity package manager
- Open the package manager
- Press the "+" button, followed by "Add package by name", and input "com.unity.renderstreaming" into the text field
- Make sure to use the pre3 version of the render streaming package
- Click "fix all" in the render streaming wizard

2. Do the unity scene setup (the example scene provided by unity may be helpful)

3. Input the correct URLs and addresses
 - Render streaming script instance:
    - Signaling URL: "ws://" + EXTERNAL_SIGNALING_SERVER_IP (e.g "ws://34.88.144.154")
    - Ice Servers -> Ice server[0] -> Urls -> Element 0: "turn:" + EXTERNAL_SIGNALING_SERVER_IP + ":3478" (e.g "turn:34.88.144.154:3478")
